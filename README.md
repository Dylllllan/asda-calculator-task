# ASDA Calculator Task

## Running the project

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm start`
4. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser

## Assumptions

- The calculator is a simple four-function calculator with no memory or history.
- The calculator only supports integer arithmetic, so division rounds down to the nearest integer.
- The behaviour of the calculator app is closely matched to the iPhone calculator app.

## Limitations

- The calculator app does not support keyboard input.
